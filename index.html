        Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer
        who is widely considered one of the most influential scientists of all
        time. He was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire,
        England, and died on March 31, 1727, in Kensington, London, England.

        <br />
        Newton is best known for his three laws of motion and his law of
        universal gravitation. His laws of motion describe how objects move in
        the absence of external forces, while his law of universal gravitation
        describes the force that attracts objects with mass to one another.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to his work on motion and gravity, Newton made many other
        contributions to science and mathematics. He invented calculus, which is
        a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and slopes of
        curves. He also made important discoveries in the fields of optics, such
        as his work on the nature of light and the invention of the reflecting
        telescope.
        <br />
        <br />
        Newton's scientific achievements had a profound impact on the world and
        helped to usher in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. His
        ideas about the laws of nature, the scientific method, and the
        importance of experimentation and observation continue to influence
        modern science today.
        <br />       
        <br />
        In addition to his scientific work, Newton also had a significant
        influence on the culture and society of his time. He served as a member
        of the British Parliament, was the Master of the Royal Mint, and was
        knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.

        Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists in history, had a
        unique educational journey that contributed to his groundbreaking
        discoveries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Newton was born in 1642 in Lincolnshire, England. His father died before
        he was born, and his mother remarried when he was three years old,
        leaving him in the care of his grandmother. Newton was not a
        particularly strong student in his early years, but he showed a keen
        interest in mathematics and science.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the age of 12, Newton was sent to the King's School in Grantham,
        where he excelled in mathematics and physics. However, his schooling was
        interrupted when his mother brought him back home to manage the family
        farm. Newton did not enjoy farming and spent much of his time reading
        and conducting experiments.
        <br />
        <br />
        When Newton was 18, his uncle, who was a graduate of Cambridge
        University, recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue higher
        education. In 1661, Newton enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where
        he studied mathematics, astronomy, and optics.
